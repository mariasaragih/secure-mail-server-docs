## Introduction

In todayâ€™s digital world, maintaining privacy and security in email communication is crucial. This documentation aims to guide you through the process of setting up a secure mail server that you can host yourself. With the right tools and configurations, you can ensure that your emails remain private and secure.

## Getting Started

To begin, you will need a server running a Linux distribution. This guide assumes you have basic knowledge of Linux commands. Ensure that your server meets the following requirements:

- A Linux server (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)
- Sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, Disk Space)
- Basic understanding of networking

### Prerequisites

1. **Domain Name**: You need a registered domain name for your mail server.
2. **Server Access**: SSH access to your server.
3. **Root Privileges**: Ensure you have root or sudo privileges on your server.

## Setting Up Haraka

Haraka is a lightweight, high-performance SMTP server written in Node.js. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Install Node.js**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nodejs npm
   ```

2. **Install Haraka**:
   ```bash
   sudo npm install -g Haraka
   ```

3. **Create a Haraka Instance**:
   ```bash
   mkdir /etc/haraka
   cd /etc/haraka
   haraka -i .
   ```

4. **Configure Haraka**:
   Edit the `config/smtp.ini` file to set up your SMTP settings.

5. **Start Haraka**:
   ```bash
   haraka -c /etc/haraka
   ```

For detailed configuration options, refer to the [Haraka documentation](https://haraka.github.io/).

## Configuring Mailcow

Mailcow is a full-featured mail server suite. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. **Clone Mailcow Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized.git
   cd mailcow-dockerized
   ```

2. **Configure Mailcow**:
   Copy the sample configuration file:
   ```bash
   cp mailcow.conf.example mailcow.conf
   ```

   Edit `mailcow.conf` to include your domain and other settings.

3. **Start Mailcow**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access Mailcow Admin Panel**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://your-domain.com`.

For more details, visit the [Mailcow documentation](https://mailcow.email/).

## DNS Configuration

Proper DNS configuration is vital for your mail server to function correctly. Here are the essential DNS records you need:

1. **A Record**: Points your domain to your serverâ€™s IP address.
2. **MX Record**: Directs email to your mail server.
3. **SPF Record**: Helps prevent spammers from sending messages on behalf of your domain.
4. **DKIM Record**: Provides a method for validating the authenticity of your emails.
5. **DMARC Record**: Helps protect your domain from unauthorized use.

Example DNS records:
```
A record: mail.your-domain.com -> your-server-ip
MX record: your-domain.com -> mail.your-domain.com
SPF record: v=spf1 a mx ~all
DKIM record: (your DKIM key)
DMARC record: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:postmaster@your-domain.com
```

## Firewall Rules

Setting up firewall rules is crucial for securing your mail server. Hereâ€™s how to configure your firewall:

1. **Allow SMTP**:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 25
   ```

2. **Allow IMAP**:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 143
   ```

3. **Allow POP3**:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 110
   ```

4. **Allow HTTPS (for Caddy)**:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 443
   ```

5. **Enable the Firewall**:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

## Wireguard VPN Setup

Using a VPN adds an extra layer of security. Follow these steps to set up Wireguard:

1. **Install Wireguard**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install wireguard
   ```

2. **Generate Keys**:
   ```bash
   wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey
   ```

3. **Configure Wireguard**:
   Edit the configuration file `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`:
   ```
   [Interface]
   PrivateKey = <your-private-key>
   Address = 10.0.0.1/24

   [Peer]
   PublicKey = <peer-public-key>
   AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
   ```

4. **Start Wireguard**:
   ```bash
   sudo wg-quick up wg0
   ```

5. **Enable Wireguard on Boot**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
   ```

For more details, refer to the [Wireguard documentation](https://www.wireguard.com/).

## Caddy Configuration

Caddy is a powerful web server that automatically manages SSL certificates. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. **Install Caddy**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install caddy
   ```

2. **Create a Caddyfile**:
   Create a file at `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` with the following content:
   ```
   your-domain.com {
       reverse_proxy localhost:your-mail-server-port
   }
   ```

3. **Start Caddy**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start caddy
   ```

4. **Enable Caddy on Boot**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable caddy
   ```

For further information, visit the [Caddy documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/).

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep your server and software updated.
2. **Use Strong Passwords**: Enforce strong password policies for user accounts.
3. **Backup Regularly**: Implement a backup strategy for your mail server data.
4. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check server logs for unusual activity.
5. **Implement 2FA**: Use two-factor authentication where possible.
